        **How to use it ?**
        
        _current weather_, _forecast_, and even _a logo in the ascii art style_‚Ä¶ what more can you hope for?

        **Is it useless ?**
        
        ~~Well, maybe.~~ Of course it‚Äôs not useless. In fact, it‚Äôs quite useful. With it you‚Äôll be able to check the weather forecast! Isn‚Äôt it exciting?
        
        
        
        **Why would I want it ?**
        
        Well, sometimes you just want to see the weather without the hazard of opening a new browser or moving your hand away from the keyboard. That‚Äôs where `KaiRoS` comes in.
        
        
        
        **What about the used and ‚Äúproven‚Äù `wttr.in` ?**
        
        ![fail1](./.hidden/failure1.gif) ![fail2](./.hidden/failure2.gif)
        
        Pretty self. explanatory. `wttr.in` is not as efficient and/or reliable as `kairos`, also, you need `curl` for it to work‚Ä¶ 
        
        
        
        **How do I get it ?**
        
        It is uploaded to **PyPI**, so everyone can download it with 
        
        ```bash
        $ python3 -m pip install wkairos --user
        ```
        ##### Note: installed with `wkairos`, but run with `kairos`
        
        ###### the name `kairos` is already taken üò≠üò≠
        ###### by ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù I mean everyone with Linux/OSX installed.
        
        
        
        **What does `kairos` mean ?**
        
        It means _weather_ in Greek. It‚Äôs the name only because it sounds nice (I basically looked that up using [google translate](https://translate.google.com))
